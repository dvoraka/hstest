### Intero
Complete interactive development program for Haskell.

### IntelliJ-Haskell
Really good IntelliJ plugin for Haskell.

This plugin depends mainly on Stack and Intero. It can create new Stack projects (by using
template hspec) and import existing Stack projects.

## How to start development

### Stack
You need to install Stack first. [Documentation](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)

### IntelliJ-Haskell
Then you need IDEA plugin. If you already use any plugin, uninstall it. For the latest
instructions see project
